# webdriverio-mocha-boilerplate

## Warning: 
I'm using this project as quick start in my workshops. It allows you to get comfortable with webdriver.
When you're looking for something you can use in production this boilerplate might not be the best choise. 

## See
- https://mochajs.org/
- http://webdriver.io/api.html

## Setup
One-time setup:
```
npm install
```

## Run tests

Start Selenium WebDriver, run this command in it's own terminal window:
```
npm run-script start-selenium
```

Start the dummy test site, run this command in it's own terminal window:
```
npm run-script start-server
```

Run the tests:
```
npm test
```

## Creating tests
To create your own tests, add your spec-file to the `test/specs/` directory. See the example.
